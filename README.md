# NistChemPy: Python API for NIST Chemistry WebBook

**NistChemPy** is an unofficial API for the [NIST Chemistry WebBook](https://webbook.nist.gov/).

This package not only automates the search and data extraction processes but also bypasses the WebBook's limitation of 400 compounds per search.

Currently, **NistChemPy** enables the extraction of basic compound properties as well as IR, THz, MS, and UV-Vis spectra.

Additional properties are available via URLs that link to their respective web pages, with potential support for direct extraction in future updates.


## Installation

Install NistChemPy using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/NistChemPy/):

```
pip install nistchempy
```


## How To

The primary features of NistChemPy, such as search capabilities and compound manipulations, are detailed in the [documentation](https://github.com/EPiCs-group/NistChemPy/blob/main/tutorial.ipynb).
